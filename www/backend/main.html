    <summary>3 - Specification</summary>
    <h3>3.1 - Web Architecture</h3>
    <div><img src="img/web.jpg" width="700px" /></div>
    <p>
      I took this slide directly from the Professor Zaccaria slides, as it is exactly the way I deployed this application. 
      The database is the data layer, while the Application server serves as application layer. The database is the one managed through Heroku,
      while the Application Server is the one generated from the swaggerUI.
      In a basic representation:
    </p>
    <div><img src="img/backend.png" width="700px" /></div>
  <p>
    The initial response will be large and serve the static files including
    all CSS, all Javascript, all HTML pages and some images, but no real
    content. The future requests will serve JSON with information from the
    database that will fill the appropriate HTML pages.
  </p>
  <h3>3.2 - API</h3>
  <h3>3.2.1 - REST compliance</h3>
  <p>
    The approach to REST principles is described by the points below:<br>

    <ul>

      <li>
        Uniform Interface: is fundamental to the design of any REST service. Interface is resource based and I use HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State). All the resources are accessible through a HTTP GET request.
      </li><br>

      <li>
        Client-Server: client and server can be developed independently and
        evolve separately with no dependency from each other.
      </li><br>

      <li>
        Stateless: in REST applications, each request must contain all of the information necessary to be understood by the server, rather than be dependent on the server remembering prior requests. Storing session state on the server violates the stateless constraint of the REST architecture. So the session state must be handled entirely by the client.
      </li><br>

      <li>
        Application Architecture: the application architecture is layered. Three main layers are available in the application: presentation, application and data.
        Each layer can interact only with the following one, in order to split responsibility among them and assigning a specific focus to each layer.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>3.3 - Data model</h3>
 

  <p>
    The relationship between entities is the following:<br>
    A staff member can organize numerous events and has only one main service. <br>
    An event can support only one service but a service can be supported by
    many events. </p>

    <summary>4 - Implementation</summary>
    <h3>4.1 - Tools used</h3>
  To develop the back end application, I used:
  <li>node js</li>
  <li>postgreSQL to manage the database</li>
  <li>Swagger to generate and manage the server and the specification</li>
  </p>
  <h3>4.2 - Description
  </h3>

  <p>
    
    I started  writing the specification of the API in Swagger where I end up with several versions in order to make it right.</br>
    I created a db directly in heroku (directly in the production it's not the right way) due to problem I faced with my mac.</br>
    After those steps were completed, I started working on the controllers then working on Html files in order to fetch data and show them on the browser client.</br>

    <summary>5 - Other Information</summary>
    <h3>5.1 - Task assignment</h3>

  <p>
    <ul class="uk-list">
    <strong>Najib El Guertit</strong><br />



        100% backend (3-4 months)<br /> 
       40% frontend (1 month)
    </ul>

  </p>

  <h3>5.2 - Analysis of existing API</h3>

  <p>
    I found that example of <a href="https://petstore.swagger.io/">Swagger Petstore</a> very helpful,
     the videos of the prof Zaccaria, meetings with Prof Gianotti, Youtube tutorials, Udemy class (Frontend and Backend) and a LOT of posts from Stackoverflow. 

  </p>
  <h3>5.4 - Learning outcome</h3>

  <p>
      I have never had an experience in javascript or node JS, postgrsql before. I started learning all this from scratch 
      and toke me a while to become familiar with the concept of developing and managing a web database. I am highly satisfied with the result.
      Thanks to all the professors were involved in this course for their directions and specially for their support.
