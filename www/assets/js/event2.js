The workshops that have been held in Cascina Brandezzata for more than two years now represent an important moment for the elderly and fragile people who live in the South Area of ​​Milan, are an opportunity to share some days with other people who have the same problems , accompanied by qualified personnel with recreational and occupational activities, building relationships and friendships. In each laboratory we try to explore new experiences and new emotions. At the end of each workshop we are proud to show everyone what we have achieved, learned and shared and that is why we always organize a big party.
